FPS.js
======

Prototype for an FPS-style game written using three.js.

Framerate-independent input handling is the most fleshed-out feature thus far. Input handling was designed to be keybind-friendly, and handle general FPS use cases well. It may not suit the needs of other styles of game or application needing input handling.
